# Playback Media Server

![Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/playitback/server.svg?branch=master)

### Currently in active development. Not yet usable. Once version 0.0.1 is available, it will be tagged. Master is the development branch.

I started making Playback Media Server because I currently run a NAS drive, which runs CouchPotato, SickBeard, Transmission and Plex. All very good, stable apps but the whole process is extremely fragmented. To check my downloads I need to go to 2 different local apps and even more to check statuses elsewhere.

Playback Media Server is a lightweight server for downloading and streaming your media. It handles both your TV Shows and Movies.

Currently the only requirement is Transmission for downloading your media. In future, I may look in to an integrated Torrent downloader, mainly just to improve fragmentation and keeping installation simpler. The integration with Transmission will be exactly the same.

## Future Scope

* Mobile apps (iPad, iPhone & Android). For both streaming and managing your media library (downloading etc)
* Streaming apps (Roku, LG, Samsung). For streaming media direct from your media server to your TV.
